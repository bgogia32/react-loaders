# Getting Started ðŸŽ¬

The easiest way to use one of the loaders from **Awesome Loaders** is to install the NPM package and import the particular loader to use it.

## Install NPM Package

```bash
npm install react-awesome-loaders
```

## Import And Use

```jsx highlight={1,6}
import { LoaderName } from "react-awesome-loaders"
...
function LoadingComponent(props) {
    return (
        ...
        <LoaderName {...passParametersToCustomise} />
        ...
    );
}
export default LoadingComponent
```

The loaders are very flexible to import and use wherever you want and in any web framework that uses NPM.  
The loaders are auto-responsive. i.e. The size of loader automatically adjusts itself on smaller screen sizes.  
Ofcourse, you can set different sizes for different screens by passing props `desktopSize` and `mobileSize`.
